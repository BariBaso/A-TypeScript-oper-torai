		<h1>TypeScript - Operators</h1>
		<img src="TypeScriptLogo.png" alt="TS logo" id="">
		<h2>What is an Operator?</h2>
		<p>An operator defines some function that will be performed on the data. The data on which operators work are called operands. Consider the following expression:</p>
		7 + 5 = 12
		Here, the values 7, 5, and 12 are operands, while + and = are operators.
		The major operators in TypeScript can be classified as:

		Arithmetic <span>operators</span>
		Logical <span>operators</span>
		Relational <span>operators</span>
		Bitwise <span>operators</span>
		Assignment <span>operators</span>
		Ternary/conditional <span>operator</span>
		String <span>operator</span>
		Type <span>operator</span>

		<h2>Relational Operators</h2>a
		<p>
			Relational Operators test or define the kind of relationship between two entities. Relational operators return a Boolean value, i.e., true/ false.
			Assume the value of A is 10 and B is 20.
		</p>
